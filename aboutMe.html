	<p>
		Hello! My name is Adam Caseñas. I am a second year student at the University of Michigan. 
	</p>

	<p> 
		I currently reside in the greater Detroit area. I attended both UofD Jesuit High School and Seaholm High School before coming to Michigan. 
	</p>

	<p>
		I am a lifelong Michigan sports fan and a diehard detroit sports fan #OnePride.
	</p>

	<p>
		When I'm not working you will often find me watching sports, lifting weights, or dancing with my headphones in.

	<p> One thing I definetly do not play about is my food. My favorite cuisines are Mexican and Japanese.</p>

	<p>
		During my spare time I am heavily involved with the program <a href = "https://givemerit.org/pages/fate"> FATE- Give Merit 
		</a>. There I am a mentor for the 9th grade cohort and I plan to stay involved with the program until at least my two mentees graduate. Within FATE, I am also a part of the FATE Planning Committee (FPC). In the FPC, we plan and organize monthly mentor meetings, mentor social events, fundraising activities, social media campaigns for mentor recruitment, and the annual “Mentor Banquet”. We are also currently working on planning a tour of the University of Michigan Ann Arbor Campus for the 10th graders. I love being able to help affirm in Detroit's youth that they are "world changers" (as we call them).
