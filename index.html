			<h4>FATE - Give Merit</h4>

			<p>
				One of my proudest involvements is with the program <a href = "https://givemerit.org/pages/fate"> FATE- Give Merit 
				</a>. There I am a mentor for the 9th grade cohort and I plan to stay involved with the program until at least my two mentees graduate. Within FATE, I am also a part of the FATE Planning Committee (FPC). In the FPC, we plan and organize monthly mentor meetings, mentor social events, fundraising activities, social media campaigns for mentor recruitment, and the annual “Mentor Banquet”. We are also currently working on planning a tour of the University of Michigan Ann Arbor Campus for the 10th graders. I love being able to help affirm in Detroit's youth that they are "world changers" (as we call them).
